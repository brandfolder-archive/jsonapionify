    # Document Structure
    # ==================
    #
    # This section describes the structure of a JSON API document, which is identified
    # by the media type [`application/vnd.api+json`]
    # (http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/vnd.api+json).
    # JSON API documents are defined in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
    # [[RFC4627](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4627)].
    #
    # Although the same media type is used for both request and response documents,
    # certain aspects are only applicable to one or the other. These differences are
    # called out below.
    #
    # Unless otherwise noted, objects defined by this specification **MUST NOT**
    # contain any additional members. Client and server implementations **MUST**
    # ignore members not recognized by this specification.
    #
    # > Note: These conditions allow this specification to evolve through additive
    # changes.
